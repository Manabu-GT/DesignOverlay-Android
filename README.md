DesignOverlay is an android app which displays a design image with grid lines to facilitate the tedious layout process.
The grid is especially useful to align to baseline grids as described in [Android Design Guidelines][1].

Download from Google Play
-------------------------

<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ms_square.android.design.overlay">
  <img alt="Android app on Google Play"
       src="https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png" />
</a>

Requirements
-------------
API Level 14 (ICS) and above.

Why is this useful?
---------------------
### Designers
Just share pixel-perfect design images with a developer, no longer need to create a redline document which specifies layout parameters of every UI element.

Note: 
Developers probably also need font styling information to implement your design since font style is hard to guess based on just images.

### Developers
With the design images shared by a designer, you can easily tweak the layout parameters using design image and grid overlay this app provides and verify design implementation. During that process, I highly recommend using [Mirror Plugin for Android Studio][2] provided by jimulabs to even facilitate the process.

How to use
------------
- Start the app and enable the switch on the top right.
- Select an image to overlay.
- Go to your app and see if the layout matches with the design image.

[Live Demo] (https://appetize.io/app/x736nfpb8hzjuqrdt3bgzhddh0)

These are just examples of how the overlay will look over an Etsy app.
(I'm using Etsy as an example since it's a great app.)

<img alt="screenshot1" src="art/screenshot_1.png" style="display:block;margin-right:10px;"/>
<img alt="screenshot2" src="art/screenshot_2.png" style="display:block"/>

Available settings
---------------------
- Show/Hide of Image/Grid
- Image to overlay
- Image transparency
- Grid size in dp (default is 4dp)
- Grid line color and transparency
- Fullscreen mode (if enabled, it will draw overlay from the top of the screen -> draws over status bar)

How to build
-------------

```
git submodule update --init
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
